I made two changes:

1) backend/server.py
   - Configured logging early so middleware/startup can use `logger`.
   - Use safe defaults for `MONGO_URL` and `DB_NAME` (mongodb://localhost:27017 and `ems`) so the server doesn't crash when .env is missing.

2) frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.js
   - Improved error reporting to include backend response detail when fetching dashboard data.

Since `git` is not available in this environment, follow these steps locally to commit the changes:

Windows (cmd):

cd "e:\Employee management system"
:: initialize git if you haven't already
:: git init
:: optional: set your name/email if first time
:: git config user.name "Your Name"
:: git config user.email "you@example.com"

:: stage changes
git add backend/server.py frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.js

:: commit
git commit -m "Fix: make backend resilient when .env missing; improve dashboard error reporting"

:: (optional) push to remote
:: git remote add origin <your-remote-url>
:: git push -u origin main

If you prefer a patch file instead, run this locally from the repo root (requires git):

git add -A
git diff --cached > changes.patch

Then you can share `changes.patch` or apply it with:

git apply changes.patch

Notes:
- I verified backend endpoints `/api/health` and `/api/dashboard/stats` return expected results when the backend is running and MongoDB is available.
- If you want me to create a proper unified diff file here, I can produce one as a text file containing the exact changes I made; tell me if you want that.
